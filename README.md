Summary in English 

Previous projects (BIOINPUT-CGL2016-78660-R, BIOLLETS-PID2019-111253RB-I00) led to the invention of a pre-emergence ecoherbicide based on mixtures of densified allelopathic biomass suitable for integrated weed management (IWM). In BIOLLETS, a formulation's phytotoxic effects and performance to control a selection of weeds in a single soil and cropping system were determined. The need then arises to validate its activity and behaviour in other soil types, climates, weed communities and cropping systems, proposing here a new four-year project with two specific objectives (O):

O1. To examine the transport of active substances released by the ecoherbicide in five representative soils of the Iberian Peninsula with characteristic mineralogy, texture, acidity, and percentage of organic matter (OM%).
O2. (a) To validate the effectiveness of the ecoherbicide in five main cropping systems on these soils, including herbicide-resistant weeds; and (b) to evaluate, after successive applications, the potential adverse effects on crops, beneficial flora, and soil micro-organisms.

To achieve them, we propose a methodology structured in four milestones (M) a
